 <p>The objection that no intermediary ought to come between man and God needs to be kept in
   its place and confined to the limits of reasonableness. That a section of the people should
   be specially ordained and specially trained in religion and theology as a clergy is not in
   itself a bad thing, even though it could be abused and turned into a bad thing. That another
   section should be willing to live a disciplined, ascetic, and secluded life devoted to meditation
   and study is also not necessarily bad and anti-social, although again it also could become so
   if the purpose of all this is wrongly understood.
